I've always wanted to write, to share my ideas with others, to show off the new things I was working on or playing with. However I have always had this sort of anxiety and fear of putting my ideas out there, thinking they have to be formal, or to be in depth descriptions of a topic.

I stumbled upon this Joel Hooks [(https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden)](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) and it changed my perspective on blogging.

This site is my personal garden, my space to share anything.

It's not going to be organized, some of the information might not even be that interesting.

My goal is to grow my garden and to share it with others, to be able to provide helpful information and ideas.

This isn't a blog, it's my digital garden. ðŸŒ¼
